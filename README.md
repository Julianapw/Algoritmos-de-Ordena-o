## Conclusion
This project enabled both practical and theoretical understanding of different sorting algorithms, identifying the efficiency and limitations of each one. **Merge Sort** proved to be consistently fast, while **Quick Sort** achieved better performance in average-case scenarios. As expected, **Bubble Sort** was the least efficient. This experience highlighted the importance of selecting algorithms based on the usage context and scalability requirements.
